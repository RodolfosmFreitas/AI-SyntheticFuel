## Research Aim
To reveal the **dependence of physicochemical properties of liquid synthetic fuels on fuel mixture chemical composition/chemical structure**.

## Research Questions
1.	Overview of liquid synthetic fuel utilization (current sources, potentials)
2.	What are the limiting physicochemical properties of liquid synthetic fuels? i.e. why can they only be used as a blending component instead of 100% for engine combustion?
3.	The dependence of **individual fuel properties** (Cetane number, density, flash point, freezing point, autoignition temperature, energy content and combustion emissions, etc.) on fuel mixture chemical composition / chemical structure.
4.	Summary of the **roadmap towards liquid synthetic fuel design for fully sustainable combustion**, based on the optimized fuel mixture chemical composition/chemical structure leading to
**100% synthetic fuel utilization in engines**.

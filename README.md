# Abstract
The physicochemical properties of liquid alternative fuels are important but
difficult to measure/predict, especially when complex surrogate fuels are concerned.
In the present work, machine learning is used to develop quantitative
structure-property relationship models. The fuel chemical structure is represented
by molecular descriptors, allowing the linking of important features of
the fuel composition and key properties of fuel utilization. Feature selection
is employed to select the most relevant features that describe the chemical
structure of the fuel and several machine learning algorithms are tested
to construct interpretable models. The effectiveness of the methodology is
demonstrated through the development of accurate and interpretable predictive
models for cetane numbers, with a focus on understanding the link
between molecular structure and fuel properties. In this context, matrix-based
descriptors and descriptors related to the number of atoms in the
molecule are directly linked with the cetane number of hydrocarbons. Furthermore,
the results showed that molecular connectivity indices play a role
in the cetane number for aromatic molecules. Also, the methodology is extended
to predict the cetane number of ester and ether molecules, leveraging
the design of alternative fuels toward fully sustainable fuel utilization.
